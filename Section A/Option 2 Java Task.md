Option 2: Java Task

Review
Correctness: The code is mostly correct. The reverse_string() function is missing a return statement, which should be added at the end of the function (line 19). The Fibonacci series function is missing a parameter, which should be added (line 28).

Efficiency: The code is efficient. The reverse_string() function uses recursion to reverse the string, which is a more efficient approach than using a loop.

Style: The code is generally written in a good style. The variable and function names are descriptive and meaningful. The indentation is consistent.

Documentation: The code is missing documentation. Comments should be added to explain the purpose of the code and the logic behind it.

Your code showed some understanding of creating arrays and all variable names were appropriately declared.
So please add comments to your code and correct some of the errors listed above.
